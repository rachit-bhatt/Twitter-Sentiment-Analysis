# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Analyzing the tweeter data using natural language processing techniques which includes data cleaning, pre-processing, and applying various ML algorithms.

Overview
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project is designed to analyze tweets from the Twitter platform and determine the overall sentiment expressed within them. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project classifies tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral based on their content.

# Features
**Data Collection:** The project collects tweets using the Twitter API or other available datasets. It ensures a diverse and representative sample of tweets for analysis.

**Preprocessing:** Raw tweet text is preprocessed to remove noise, including special characters, URLs, and hashtags. Tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal are also performed.

**Feature Extraction:** Text features are extracted from the preprocessed tweets. Common methods include bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings.

**Model Training:** Various machine learning models (such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models) are trained on labeled data to predict sentiment. Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimal performance.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation helps assess generalization.

**Visualization:** Visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts) are created to showcase sentiment distribution and most frequent terms.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11.02
- Required libraries (e.g., NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)
- Twitter API credentials (if collecting real-time tweets)

## Installation:
1. **Clone the Repository:** First, clone the GitHub repository for your Twitter Sentiment Analysis project:
```
git clone https://github.com/rachit-bhatt/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Since you don’t have a requirements.txt, you can install the necessary Python libraries individually. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas matplotlib

3. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Obtain Twitter API keys (if you’re collecting real-time tweets) and configure them in your code.
Collect tweets using Tweepy or other methods.
Preprocess the raw tweet text by removing noise (special characters, URLs, hashtags), tokenizing, stemming, and removing stop words.

4. **Feature Extraction and Model Training:**
Extract relevant features from the preprocessed tweets (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF).
Train sentiment analysis models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM) using labeled data.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

5. **Visualization:**
Create visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts) to showcase sentiment distribution and important terms.

6. **Usage:**
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository to run the analysis.
